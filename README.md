# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

NPM RUN DEV
to start dev environment on your local machine

TDD approach
Create smoke tests for MVP, build functionality, as soon as those tests are passing, refactor, add more tests, or move to the next functionality and repeat the cycle.

Testing strategy
Based on queries priority mentioned in [ReactTestingLibrary docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about#priority) i should focus on highest possible queries specifity.

Future improvements
Could use langChain.js for bot or prediction for next matches` outcomes
